# cvw_dashboardlinks

This is a Perch CMS dashboard widget that displays a list of links. Links are added by an admin user in the Perch Settings page. Possible uses include:

* A list of links to custom Perch help pages.
* Link to Google Analytics accounts.
* A list of links to screencasts that show how Perch works.
* Links to other areas of Perch admin, for example, link to a specific region/collection for editing.
* A link to the developer's website.

### Note: 

This is personal project for me to learn about Perch widgets.
