# cvw_dashboardlinks

This is a Perch CMS dashboard widget that displays a list of links. Links are added by a user in the Perch Settings page. Possible uses include:

* A list of links to custom Perch help pages.
* Link to Google Analytics accounts.
* A list of links to screencasts that show how Perch works.
* Links to other areas of Perch admin, for example, link to a specific region/collection for editing.
* A link to the developer's website.

Perch 3.0 required.

## Instructions

Upload the `cvw_dashboardlinks` folder into `/perch/addons/apps`. Edit Dashboard Links settings in Perch Admin -> Settings. Save and the widget should appear on your dashboard.

Currently, the widget can display up to three links. The second and third links can be left blank if you want.

### Note: 

* This is a personal project for me to learn about Perch widgets.
* Perch dashboard widgets are re-ordered via drag and drop although there is a bug with some versions of Perch where this functionality is broken. Perch themselves know about this.
